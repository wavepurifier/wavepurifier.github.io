		<h1>WAVEPURIFIER: Purify the Audio Adversarial Examples Using Hierarchical Diffusion Models </h1>
		<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div>
		<p>We present audio examples for our purification output in three attacks. We compare the result with existing defense methods, and present the transcriptions on ASR (Aotomated Speech Recognition) models.
			For each audio, <b>we provide the transcriptions under the audio</b>. 
			<p>[Code]</p>

			<div id="list-div">
				<ul>
				  <li><b>Benign:</b> The benign audio.</li>
				  <li><b>XX AE:</b> The AE crafted by different audio adversarial attacks.</li>
				  <li><b>Down-Up 2k:</b> Make a downsampling and upsampling to 2kHz to defend the AE. Proposed by <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21-hussain.pdf">USENIX 2021: WaveGuard</a></li>
				  <li><b>LPC 10:</b> Use Linear Predictive Coding with 10th oreder filter to defend the AE. Proposed by <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21-hussain.pdf">USENIX 2021: WaveGuard</a></li>
				  <li><b>Quant 8:</b> Quantilize the audio samples in 8 bits and then reconstruct back to defend the AE. Proposed by <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21-hussain.pdf">USENIX 2021: WaveGuard</a></li>
				  <li><b>ANR:</b> Use adaptive noise reduction to defend the AE. Proposed by <a href="https://pypi.org/project/noisereduce/">PLoS computational biology</a></li>
				  <li><b>SNR:</b> Use stationary noise reduction to defend the AE. Proposed by <a href="https://pypi.org/project/noisereduce/">PLoS computational biology</a></li>
				  <li><b>DiffSpec:</b> Use Mel-spectrogram based diffusion model to purify AE. Proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01507.pdf">ICLR 2023: AudioPure</a></li>
				  <li><b>DiffWave:</b> Use waveform based diffusion model to purify AE. Proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01507.pdf">ICLR 2023: AudioPure</a></li>
				  <li><b>Ours:</b> Use our <b>WAVEPURIFIER</b> to defend the AE.</li>
